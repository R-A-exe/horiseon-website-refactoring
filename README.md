## Details

### HTML

The original HTML file presented the following weaknesses:

1. Heavy use of div containers;
2. No alternative descriptions for images;
3. Random structure, not logical sequence.

The code was improved as follows:

1. Semantic tags were applied to the code (header, main, aside, section, footer) to provide additional metadata to the standard div container;
2. All images have alternative descriptions, and the file has a descriptive title;
3. The code structure was reviewed and improved to reflect a logical progression.

### CSS

The original CSS file presented the following challenges:

1. Overuse of classes with one-off applications;
2. No consolidation of global formatting;
3. No structure;
4. No comments;

The following improvements were made to the CSS file:

1. Classes were consolidated, and redudant classes were eliminated;
2. Structure was reshuffled to match HTML logic;
3. Comments were added.

### Other

No changes were made to the layout, look and feel, or content of the webpage. The purpose of this was task was strictly to improve the efficiency of the code without any changes to the webpage.
